This page describes how to install the environment to run the robot. You mainly need to prepare the following parts:
* TimeScaleDB: a high-performance time series database based on postgresql, used to store data such as candle and orders.
* golang: it is recommended to use the latest version

Banbot supports the high-performance indicator library [banta](https://github.com/banbox/banta) out of the box, and you can quickly develop custom indicators based on it.

## Install TimeScaleDB database
It is recommended to install the latest stable version according to the official documentation:
* [Installation in linux](https://docs.timescale.com/self-hosted/latest/install/installation-linux/)
* [Installation in MacOS](https://docs.timescale.com/self-hosted/latest/install/installation-macos/)
* [Installation in Windows](https://docs.timescale.com/self-hosted/latest/install/installation-windows/)
* [Installation using Docker](https://docs.timescale.com/self-hosted/latest/install/installation-docker/)
  ::: warning Docker installation tips
  When executing docker run, please add the `-v /your/data/dir:/home/postgres/pgdata/data` parameter to map the data to the host directory.
  :::

### Initialize the table structure
Download the [sql file](/sql.zip), unzip it and prepare for execution.

Use the `psql` tool to log in to the database
```shell
psql -d "postgres://<username>:<password>@<host>:<port>"
```
Then create the database and execute the SQL file:
```postgresql
CREATE database bantd;
\c bantd  -- switch active database
\i /path/to/schema.sql
\i /path/to/schema2.sql
```
::: tip Docker Tips
If you use docker to start TimeScaleDB, please put the two decompressed sql files in the host root directory of `-v`.
Then execute the following command to open `psql`:
```shell
docker exec -it timescaledb psql -U postgres -h localhost
```
The sql file path for `-i` should be `/home/postgres/pgdata/data/schema.sql`
:::
Check if TimestampcaleDB is installed:
```postgresql
\dx
```
