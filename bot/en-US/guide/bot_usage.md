After writing the strategy, you can package the strategy and banbot into a single executable file (Please ensure that you execute the command in the root directory of your strategy project):
```shell
# for linux/macos
go build -o bot

# for windows
go build -o bot.exe
```
Then you can use this executable file directly to start the UI, backtest, hyperparameter optimization, real trading, etc.!

Directly executing `bot` will start the WebUI interface at `http://localhost:8000`, through which you can manage strategies, backtest, analyze transactions, etc.

Running `bot -help` will display a list of subcommand help:
```text
banbot 0.1.5
please run with a subcommand:
        trade:      live trade
        backtest:   backtest with strategies and data
        spider:     start the spider
        optimize:   run hyper parameters optimization
        bt_opt:     backtest over optimize
        kline:      run kline commands
        tick:       run tick commands
        tool:       run tools
        web:        run web dashboard
```
## Common command parameters
**Data directory (-datadir)**

When you start through the command line, unless the environment variable `BanDataDir` is set, you must pass in the parameter `-datadir` to specify the data directory each time you start.

**Default configuration file**

Before reading the additional configuration files you passed in, banbot will try to read two default configuration files from the data directory: `config.yml` and `config.local.yml`.

If these two have already covered the parameters you need this time, you do not need to pass in the configuration file path through `-config`.

**Command help information**

You can display help information by adding `-help` or `-h` parameters after the command.

## Start WebUI Research & Backtesting
To facilitate your strategy research and backtesting, we provide WebUI visualization. You can edit strategies online, start backtesting, view profit and loss curves, analyze orders, etc. through WebUI.

This is a WebUI only for the strategy research stage. By default, only your local computer is allowed to access it, so you can access it without authentication. If you need to access it from the external network, please set `-host 0.0.0.0`.

If you need to access the Dashboard UI during real-time trading in banbot, please refer to [Real-time Trading](#start-real-time-trading-simulated-tradingreal-trading)。

```text
Usage of web:
  -host string
        bind host ip (default "127.0.0.1")
  -port int
        port to listen (default 8000)
  -config value
        config path to use, Multiple -config options may be used
  -datadir string
        Path to data dir.
  -db string
        db file path (default "dev.db")
  -level string
        log level (default "info")

  -tz string
        timezone (default "utc")
```

## Start the crawler process
```shell
bot spider [-datadir PATH] [-c PATH] [-c PATH]
```
When you want to start real-time trading, you need to start the crawler process first. The crawler process listens to the `6789` port by default and only accepts local requests. You can change the yml configuration `spider_addr` to `0.0.0.0:6789` to accept external listening requests.

After the crawler process is started, it does not listen to any exchange, market, or symbol by default. It will automatically connect to the specified exchange, market, and listen to the required information based on the client request received.
```text
Usage of spider:
  -config value
        config path to use, Multiple -config options may be used
  -datadir string
        Path to data dir.
  -level string
        set logging level to debug (default "info")
  -logfile string
        Log to the file specified
  -max-pool-size int
        max pool size for db
  -no-compress
        disable compress for hyper table
  -no-default
        ignore default: config.yml, config.local.yml
  -nodb
        dont save orders to database
```
## Start real-time trading (simulated trading/real trading)
```shell
bot trade [-spider] [-pairs PAIRS] ...
```
When you specify `env` as `dry_run` in the yml configuration file, the order will not be submitted to the exchange, but simulated matching locally.

When `env` is set to `prod` or `test`, it will be submitted to the production environment or test network of the exchange respectively (some exchanges do not support test networks).

You can configure `spider_addr` in yml, and the robot will automatically try to connect to the crawler when it starts, and subscribe to the current exchange, market and related symbol data.

You can also add the `-spider` parameter to automatically start the crawler in this process when starting the robot.

When you enable `api_server` in the `yml` configuration file and set the access account and password, you can view and manage your real-time trading robot with the Dashboard UI.

```yaml
api_server:
  enabled: true  # enable here
  bind_ip: 0.0.0.0
  port: 8001
  jwt_secret_key: '123456789'  # This should be complicated enough
  users:
    - user: ban
      pwd: '123'
      acc_roles: {user1: admin}  # allow bot accounts and role
```

        hash code to use
  -task-id int
        task
```
## Backtesting
```shell
bot backtest [-nodb] [-separate] ...
```
This will start the backtest according to the `run_policy` in the yml configuration. Since the backtest may generate a large number of orders, it is recommended that you enable the `-nodb` option to not record the orders in the database, but only save them in a csv file.

The default backtest is to run multiple strategy groups configured by `run_policy` at the same time to get a combined backtest report. If you want to test each strategy group in `run_policy` separately, please enable the `-separate` option.

During the backtest, if the candle of the relevant symbol does not exist, it will be automatically downloaded and saved to the database.

After the backtest is completed, the backtest results will be saved in `[data directory]/backtest/task_[TASKID]` by default. If you specify `-nodb`, `[TASKID]` is -1, that is, saved in the `task_-1` directory
```text
Usage of backtest:
  -config value
        config path to use, Multiple -config options may be used
  -cpu-profile
        enable cpu profile
  -datadir string
        Path to data dir.
  -level string
        set logging level to debug (default "info")
  -logfile string
