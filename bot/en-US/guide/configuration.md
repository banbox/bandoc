banbot has a wide range of configuration options. By default, these are configured through the `yaml` configuration file.

## Data Directory
Every time you start backtesting or real trading, you need to pass in the `-datadir` parameter, which is the data directory. You can also configure the environment variable `BanDataDir` and ignore the `-datadir` parameter.

You can store several yaml configuration files in the data directory. When backtesting, a `backtest` subdirectory will be automatically created in the data directory to store the backtest results.

## Yaml Configuration File
banbot can receive several configuration file paths from command line parameters. If the following configuration files have the same configuration as the previous ones, the previous ones will be overwritten.

You can divide the configuration files into multiple parts and pass them in one by one for easy maintenance.

#### Default Configuration File
banbot will try to read two configuration files from the data directory by default: `config.yml` and `config.local.yml`.

You can create these two configuration files directly. You don't need to pass them in when starting banbot, and they will be read automatically.

`config.yml` is recommended to store relatively complete default configurations that do not need to be modified frequently.
It is recommended to store local related configurations in `config.local.yml`, such as exchange api/secret, api_server and other configurations.

## Important details configuration
#### Configure single order amount
The minimum order amount depends on the exchange and currency pair, and is usually listed on the exchange support page.

When the robot starts, it will automatically load the exchange market information, which includes the order amount and other restrictions for all varieties. Banbot also limits the minimum single transaction amount to 10USD.

You can configure the single transaction amount through `stake_pct` or `stake_amount`. Note that for futures contracts, these two parameters refer to the nominal value, not the occupied margin.

If you need to use different transaction amounts for different accounts, you can configure the amount multiplier in `exchange.[exg_name].account_prods.user1.stake_rate`. The default is 1; changing it to `<1` will reduce the order amount of this account. `>1` will increase the order amount of this account

Similarly, you can also set different order amount multipliers for different strategies `TradeStrat.StakeRate`

#### Global stop loss
You can use `fatal_stop` to set the robot to stop trading for `fatal_stop_hours` hours when the robot's combined loss of all strategy tasks reaches a certain percentage within x minutes.
