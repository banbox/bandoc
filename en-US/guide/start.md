## Q & A
**What is the difference between the strategy project and banbot? Do I need to pull the banbot source code?**

You do not need to pull the banbot source code; you only need to reference the latest version of banbot via `go get` in your strategy project.  
The strategy project is the go project where you maintain all your strategy code, and it is also the place where you directly use `go build` to compile into a single executable file.

**What should I do if I don't understand the document?**

You can download the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/banbox/bandoc/) of this document, then open it with Cursor, and @codebase in the chat to ask any questions you have; Cursor will combine all the content of the document to provide you with a more understandable explanation.
