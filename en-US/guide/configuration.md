banbot has a wide range of configuration options. By default, these are configured through the `yaml` configuration file.

## Data Directory
Every time you start backtesting or real trading, you need to pass in the `-datadir` parameter, which is the data directory. You can also configure the environment variable `BanDataDir` and ignore the `-datadir` parameter.

You can store several yaml configuration files in the data directory. When backtesting, a `backtest` subdirectory will be automatically created in the data directory to store the backtest results.

## Yaml Configuration File
banbot can receive several configuration file paths from command line parameters. If the following configuration files have the same configuration as the previous ones, the previous ones will be overwritten.

You can divide the configuration files into multiple parts and pass them in one by one for easy maintenance.

#### Default Configuration File
banbot will try to read two configuration files from the data directory by default: `config.yml` and `config.local.yml`.

You can create these two configuration files directly. You don't need to pass them in when starting banbot, and they will be read automatically.

`config.yml` is recommended to store relatively complete default configurations that do not need to be modified frequently.
It is recommended to store local related configurations in `config.local.yml`, such as exchange api/secret, api_server and other configurations.

## Important details configuration
#### Configure single order amount
The minimum order amount depends on the exchange and currency pair, and is usually listed on the exchange support page.

When the robot starts, it will automatically load the exchange market information, which includes the order amount and other restrictions for all varieties. Banbot also limits the minimum single transaction amount to 10USD.

You can configure the single transaction amount through `stake_pct` or `stake_amount`. Note that for futures contracts, these two parameters refer to the nominal value, not the occupied margin.

If you need to use different transaction amounts for different accounts, you can configure the amount multiplier in `exchange.[exg_name].account_prods.user1.stake_rate`. The default is 1; changing it to `<1` will reduce the order amount of this account. `>1` will increase the order amount of this account

Similarly, you can also set different order amount multipliers for different strategies `TradeStrat.StakeRate`

#### Global stop loss
You can use `fatal_stop` to set the robot to stop trading for `fatal_stop_hours` hours when the robot's combined loss of all strategy tasks reaches a certain percentage within x minutes.

#### Environment
The optional values for `env` are:
- `prod`: Production network
- `test`: Test network
- `dry_run`: Simulated live trading, with local matching and no submission to the exchange. This is only effective when running `trade` for real-time trading.

**Note**: Currently, the product IDs are not distinguished between `prod` and `test`. If you have already downloaded the K-line data, you need to delete the existing K-line data before switching environments, otherwise, there will be confusion.

#### Product Filtering and Periodic Refresh
In addition to configuring fixed products through `pairs`, you can also use `pairlists` to dynamically filter and determine trading products. If you want to enable this, make sure `pairs` is empty.

`pairlists` provides several filters that can be used to filter products based on dimensions such as trading volume, price, volatility, liquidity, and correlation.

If you need to periodically recalculate the product list, you can configure `pairmgr.cron`. When `force_filters` is set to `true`, the `pairlists` filters will be forcibly applied to `pairs`.

Both `pairmgr` and `pairlists` support live trading and backtesting. If you enable them during backtesting, historical data will be used for filtering. This ensures that the dynamically calculated product list will be exactly the same when you start backtesting/live trading at different times with the same configuration.

#### Real-Time Synchronization Settings
When requesting authenticated exchange interfaces, a timestamp is generally required. If the local computer's time has a large deviation from the network time, it may cause the request to fail.

Banbot provides the `ntp_lang_code` configuration item, which can be used to automatically detect the local time deviation (by requesting a specified NTP server to calculate the time deviation), and then use the real network time to initiate exchange requests.

The optional values for `ntp_lang_code` are:
- `none`: Not enabled
- `zh-CN`: China
- `zh-HK`: Hong Kong
- `zh-TW`: Taiwan
- `ja-JP`: Japan
- `ko-KR`: South Korea
- `zh-SG`: Singapore
- `global`: Global NTP servers: google, apple, facebook, etc.

#### Multi-Account Configuration
You can configure multiple accounts in `accounts`, and each account can have different parameters.

The parameters that can be configured for each account are:
- `no_trade`: Whether to prohibit trading for this account
- `stake_rate`: Order amount multiplier, the actual order amount multiplier is the global `stake_rate` multiplied by the account's `stake_rate`
- `leverage`: Contract leverage
- `max_stake_amt`: Maximum allowed single order amount
- `max_pair`: Maximum number of products allowed for this account
- `max_open_orders`: Maximum number of open orders allowed for this account

During backtesting or simulated trading, only the configuration of the first account will be used for trading.

#### Relay Unfinished Order
For strategies with long holding periods in large cycles, where an order may hold for one or two months, you may already have some positions according to the trading signals when you start the robot. To fully follow the signals, you should enter the positions immediately and hold the corresponding positions instead of waiting for the next signal to be issued.

When `relay_sim_unfinish` is set to `true`, it will automatically backtest the previous 500 K-lines when starting to trade a product, obtain the unliquidated orders, and then enter the positions immediately according to these orders.

This configuration item is effective in both backtesting and live trading.

## Email Notification Configuration

banbot supports email notification functionality, which can send email alerts when exceptions or other important events occur.

### Basic Email Configuration

Add email server configuration to the configuration file:

```yaml
mail:
  enable: true                    # Whether to enable email functionality
  host: smtp.example.com         # SMTP server address
  port: 465                      # SMTP port (usually 465 or 587)
  username: user1@example.com    # Email username
  password: your_password        # Email password or app password
```

> **Authorization Password**: Generally need to use authorization password instead of login password
> **Firewall**: Ensure the server allows SMTP port access

### Email Notification Channel Configuration

Configure email notification channels in `rpc_channels`:

```yaml
rpc_channels:
  mail_notify:                   # Channel name (customizable)
    type: mail                   # Channel type: mail
    disable: false               # Whether to disable this channel
    msg_types: [exception]       # Message types: exception
    accounts: []                 # Specified accounts (empty means all accounts)
    keywords: []                 # Keyword filtering (empty means no filtering)
    retry_delay: 1000           # Retry delay (milliseconds)
    min_intv_secs: 300          # Minimum sending interval (seconds)
    touser: 'recipient@abc.com'  # Recipient email address
```
> **Sending Frequency**: It's recommended to set `min_intv_secs` to avoid frequent email sending

## Live Trading Scheduled Backtest Comparison Feature

This feature allows scheduled execution of backtests during live trading and compares backtest order results with live trading orders to help confirm whether the strategy's performance in live trading meets expectations.

### Configure Live Trading Backtest

```yaml
bt_in_live:
  cron: "30 3 0 * * *"           # Cron expression (second minute hour day month weekday), execute at 00:03:30 daily
  account: "user1"               # Specify the account to execute backtest
  mail_to:                       # Email notification recipient list
    - "trader1@example.com"
    - "manager@example.com"
```
